[I wrote a very simple plan post-grad for me and my cohort.](https://meowing-night-45e.notion.site/My-LeetCode-Plan-e8bf90b449b24475a50ea5a9899747bb)

# 1. Two Sum

Started this at midnight or smth. Kinda cheated on this one. Before I decided to use Python to do leetcode problems, I asked ChatGPT to write a leetcode solution in C++, Golang, Rust, Python, and JavaScript so I could see how readable the language is and get a general sense and understanding of how the languages looked. I am still interested in all of these languages, but I figure the best tool for the job is Python. Coming back to how I cheated, the solution that ChatGPT decided to write was this problem, likely because it's the first and easiest one. There are more brute force solutions, but the idea of keeping track of what you iterated through with a map is an idea that stuck with me from chatting with GPT.

# 217. Contains Duplicate

I first attempted this with a map and got a little more than half the tests to pass out of 75 with my first attempt but this approach was naive as it didn't account for the case of arrays of size 2 with a duplicate entry. I since implemented it using a set, which will not insert duplicate entries, and so I can check for size at the end of the loop if it changed.
