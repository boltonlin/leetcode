# 242. Valid Anagram

## Solutions

### My initial solution

```py
class Solution:
    def makeDict(self, s: str) -> dict:
        d = {}
        for char in list(s):
            if not char in d.keys():
                d[char] = 1
            else:
                d[char] += 1
        return d

    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_dict = self.makeDict(s)
        t_dict = self.makeDict(t)
        return s_dict == t_dict
```

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_counter = Counter(s)
        s_counter.subtract(t)

## Observations

- I've ran the submission multiple times for ChatGPT's solutions and generally the runtime is anywhere between 30 - 51ms, so it's not like the improved third solution is that much worse.
- Learned about deep equality `==` and `Counter()` in this exercise.
- Learning python and vim at the same time for these exercises is a little painful. I find myself toggling it off here where I need to copy and paste things that aren't in a code editor.

# 49. Group Anagrams

I thought I would use `isAnagram` from #242 here. I learned more about standard python naming conventions and the unary `*` 'unpacking' or 'splat' operator with this problem. The below is [the most upvoted answer](https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams/solutions/19202/5-line-python-solution-easy-to-understand/?orderBy=most_votes&languageTags=python) for this problem, notable because it uses 5 lines:

```py
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        letters_to_words = defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            letters_to_words[tuple(sorted(word))].append(word)
        return list(letters_to_words.values())
```

Some nice notes:

- Tuples are hashable and thus can be used as keys in a `dict`
- `defaultdict` is what I was looking for. It will provide a default value for a nonexistent key. In this case, it is an empty `list`
- `defaultdict([])` will **not** work since `[]`, an empty list, will be created once the `defaultdict` is instantiated, then reused for all missing keys

# 347. Top K Frequent Elements

I didn't want to use `Counter` since I felt it was kinda cheating? This is how I'd implement it with `Counter`

```py
from typing import List


class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        counter = Counter(nums)
        return sorted(counter, key=counter.get, reverse=True)[:k]

# Accepted
# 21/21 cases passed (98 ms)
# Your runtime beats 91.72 % of python3 submissions
# Your memory usage beats 88.24 % of python3 submissions (18.6 MB)
```

I opted to avoid using it and came up with following:

```py
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict


class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        counter = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            counter[num] += 1
        result = sorted(counter, key=counter.get, reverse=True)
        return result[:k]

# Accepted
# 21/21 cases passed (99 ms)
# Your runtime beats 89.5 % of python3 submissions
# Your memory usage beats 88.24 % of python3 submissions (18.6 MB)
```

In retrospect, it's not that much more notable. Trying to understand ChatGPT's answer...

```py
from typing import List
import heapq

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        counts = [0] * (max(nums) + 1)
        for num in nums:
            counts[num] += 1
        top_counts = heapq.nlargest(k, range(len(counts)), counts.__getitem__)
        return [num for num in top_counts]
```

It feels like `counts` is a sort of pseudo-dict since the indices can act as keys where the key is a num in `nums`, but I don't think this is practical if large negative numbers are used, which is within the scope of this problem since a constraint is `nums[i]` exists within range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

- Confirmed with ChatGPT that this solution does not work with negative `nums[i]`.

I like its second solution which uses a heap. Wrapping my head around a heap again was a little difficult, but I'm glad I went through it. Their solution using a heap:

```py
from typing import List
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for num in nums:
            counts[num] += 1
        min_heap = [(-count, num) for num, count in counts.items()]
        heapq.heapify(min_heap)
        top_k = [heapq.heappop(min_heap)[1] for _ in range(k)]
        return top_k
```

- `heapify()` in Python will always transform a list into a min-heap, which means the smallest value after performing heap operations like `heappop()` or `heappush()` will always be at the root (index 0). I really enjoyed this diagram courtesy of [HackerRank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0Cq6tVNRBA) showing how we can represent a Heap as an array without the overhead of using a class or other complicated data structure.
  ![](https://i.imgur.com/xxagaN1.jpeg)
- The time complexity for this is O(n + k log n) since `heapify()` is O(n) and `heappop()` is O(log n) and you have to do `heappop()` k times
- It is better than my first solution `iff k << n`, which is mostly true in this problem since k is **always** less than or equal to n, and is very likely significantly less than n given the nature of this problem. You wouldn't need this algorithm if all elements are unique, and would likely not need this algorithm if you only have a few anomalies to filter out
