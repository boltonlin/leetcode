# 242. Valid Anagram

## Solutions

### My initial solution

```py
class Solution:
    def makeDict(self, s: str) -> dict:
        d = {}
        for char in list(s):
            if not char in d.keys():
                d[char] = 1
            else:
                d[char] += 1
        return d

    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_dict = self.makeDict(s)
        t_dict = self.makeDict(t)
        return s_dict == t_dict
```

### ChatGPT after asking for a better solution

```py
from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_counter = Counter(s)
        t_counter = Counter(t)
        return s_counter == t_counter
```

### ChatGPT after asking for it to improve its solution

```py
from collections import Counter


class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        s_counter = Counter(s)
        s_counter.subtract(t)
        return all(count == 0 for count in s_counter.values())
```

## Observations

- I've ran the submission multiple times for ChatGPT's solutions and generally the runtime is anywhere between 30 - 51ms, so it's not like the improved third solution is that much worse.
- Learned about deep equality `==` and `Counter()` in this exercise.
- Learning python and vim at the same time for these exercises is a little painful. I find myself toggling it off here where I need to copy and paste things that aren't in a code editor.
