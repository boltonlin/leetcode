# LintCode 659. Encode and Decode Strings

## Problem

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a string. The encoded string is then sent over the network and is decoded back to the original list of strings.

Please implement `encode` and `decode`

## [Solution](../lintcode_solutions/659.encode-and-decode-strings.py)

The `encode` method takes a list of strings and returns a single encoded string. The `decode` method takes an encoded string and returns a list of strings.

The encoding scheme works by replacing all colons in the input strings with a double colon. Each input string is then separated by a colon followed by a semicolon. The decoding scheme works by iterating through the encoded string and building up each input string by replacing double colons with a single colon. Any occurrence of `:;` that isn't escaped by a prepended `:` will tokenize the string and insert it to the list.
