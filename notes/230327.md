## [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)
### Problem
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest _substring_ without repeating characters.

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

#### Example 1
```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### Constraints
- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

### Preliminary Solution
- __Time Complexity__: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Use a sliding window. Iterate through the characters and add them to a set. If a duplicate is found, reset the set, shift the start of the window by 1 and close the window, then repeat the process.

#### Solution Code
```py
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    unique_chars = set()
    longest = 0
    start, end = 0, 0
    while end < len(s):
        old_size = len(unique_chars)
        unique_chars.add(s[end])
        new_size = len(unique_chars)
        longest = max(longest, new_size)
        if new_size == old_size:
            start += 1
            end = start
            unique_chars = set()
            continue
        end += 1
    return longest
```

- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Use a hash map and iterate through the array with a sliding window, adding characters and their indices to the map and updating the output with the window's size. When a duplicate is found, the start of the window moves to the right of the last seen duplicate, then the duplicate's stored index is updated to the new index.

#### Solution Code
```
def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
    seen = {}
    l = 0
    output = 0
    for r in range(len(s)):
        """
        If s[r] not in seen, we can keep increasing the window size by moving right pointer
        """
        if s[r] not in seen:
            output = max(output,r-l+1)
        """
        There are two cases if s[r] in seen:
        case1: s[r] is inside the current window, we need to change the window by moving left pointer to seen[s[r]] + 1.
        case2: s[r] is not inside the current window, we can keep increase the window
        """
        else:
            if seen[s[r]] < l:
                output = max(output,r-l+1)
            else:
                l = seen[s[r]] + 1
        seen[s[r]] = r
    return output
```
