## [20. Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)
### Problem
Given a string s containing just the characters `'('`, `')'`, `'{'`, `'}'`, `'['` and `']'`, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.

Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

#### Example 1
```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

#### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
- `s` consists of parentheses only `'()[]{}'`.

### Best Available Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    open_brackets = ["(", "{","["]
    close_brackets = [")", "}","]"]
    stack = []
    for char in s:
        if char in open_brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        if char in close_brackets:
            if not len(stack):
                return False
            compare = stack.pop()
            if close_brackets.index(char) != open_brackets.index(compare):
                return False
    return True if not len(stack) else False
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Scan the characters and push onto a stack whenever you encounter an open bracket. When you encounter a closed bracket, return false if the stack is empty or doesn't match the bracket that was pushed.

#### Notes
- Really easy solution. âœŒðŸ˜‰
