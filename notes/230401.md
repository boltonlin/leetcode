```
- __Time Complexity__: O(TIME)
- __Space Complexity__: O(SPACE)

#### _Backside_
Put a small compact description that can fit on the back of a flashcard here. It should describe your 'initial approach' and by design is rough and can be improved upon.

#### Additional Details
Put any additional details or detailed description of the solution here. Not meant to go on a flashcard, but should be something you refer to in the case that you don't understand your compact descriptions.

#### Notes

#### _Backside_
Keep a counter for what is in the window, and a counter of the target `t` string. Use a sliding window technique. When a character within the `t` is found, begin extending the window until all characters in `t` are found. When they are found, register the result (if new or smaller length than previous result) then shrink the window from the start and keep registering the result so long as your counter is satisfied. When a character within the target is removed and the count is unsatisfied, begin extending the window from the end until it is.
