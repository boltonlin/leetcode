## [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/)
### Problem
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

`[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
`[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.
Notice that rotating an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return the *minimum element* of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time`.
#### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

#### Constraints
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

### Preliminary Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def findMin(nums) -> int:

    if len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]

    mid = len(nums) // 2
    lmax = nums[mid - 1]
    rmax = nums[len(nums) - 1]

    # even 
    if len(nums) % 2 == 0:
        lead = min(lmax, rmax)
        if mid == 1:
            return lead
        if lead == lmax:
            return findMin(nums[:mid])
        else:
            return findMin(nums[mid:])

    # odd 
    else:
        pivot = nums[mid]
        lead = min(pivot, lmax, rmax)
        if mid == 1:
            return lead
        if lead == pivot:
            return pivot
        elif lead == lmax:
            return findMin(nums[:mid])
        else:
            return findMin(nums[mid + 1:])
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(log n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(log n)

#### _Backside_
Split the array into two parts and compare the maximum values in each half. If the pivot point is the minimum, we return that, but otherwise, we recurse and search in the half which has the smaller max. Since the array is sorted and rotated, the minimum has to be in the half that has the smaller max value.

#### Solution Code
```py
def findMin(self, nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums)-1
            
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
                    
        if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
            left = mid + 1

        else:
            right = mid
            
    return nums[left]
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(log n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Initialize the left and right bounds of the search window. Calculate a `mid` point that leans left when the window is of even length. If the number at the mid point is greater than the right bound, then the mid point must be part of the left sorted array and the rotations have placed the minimum somewhere in the right portion. Thus we shift the left pointer up. If it isn't, then it must be part of the right sorted array, and the minimum is somewhere in the left portion, so we pull the `right` pointer to become `mid`. `left` and `right` will converge with no values lost, and once `left == right`, the minimum will be found.
