## [33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/)
### Problem
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly rotated at an unknown pivot index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 3 and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

#### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

#### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`

### Preliminary Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def search(nums, target) -> int:
    res = -1
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if nums[mid] > nums[r]:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    min_index = l

    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
    if target < nums[r]:
        l = min_index
    elif target > nums[r]:
        r = min_index - 1
        if r < 0:
            r += len(nums)
    else:
        return r

    while l < r:
        mid = (l + r) //2
        if target > nums[mid]:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid
    if nums[l] == target:
        return l

    return res
```

- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
If the array is rotated, find the minimum index to split the array into two sorted halves. If the target is less than the right index, then it is in the right sorted half, and vice versa. Finally, conduct a binary search on the chosen half (or the entire array if it's not rotated) for the target value.

### [Alternate Solution](https://github.com/neetcode-gh/leetcode/blob/main/python/0033-search-in-rotated-sorted-array.py)

#### Solution Code
```py
def search(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1

    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if target == nums[mid]:
            return mid

        # left sorted portion
        if nums[l] <= nums[mid]:
            if target > nums[mid] or target < nums[l]:
                l = mid + 1
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        # right sorted portion
        else:
            if target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
    return -1

```

- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Split the problem up into multiple discrete cases. At each iteration of the loop, determine if you are in the left sorted portion, or the right sorted portion. You can make this determination by comparing the bounds with the middle pointer. For example, if `num[l] <= nums[mid]`, the window is in the left sorted portion. Depending on which sorted portion the window surrounds, the pointers must be adjusted accordingly. For example, if you are in the right sorted portion, you will adjust the right pointer if `target < nums[mid] or target > nums[r]`.
