## [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)
### Problem
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.
#### Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

#### Example 2
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/rev1ex2.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```
#### Example 3
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

### Solution

#### Solution Code
```
def reverseList(head):
    prev, curr = None, head
    while curr:
        temp = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = temp
    return prev
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Initialize two pointers `prev` and `curr`. Hold `curr.next` in a `temp` pointer. Set `curr`'s next pointer to point to `prev`, then shift `prev` to be `curr` and `curr` to be the `temp` pointer. The loop will terminate when `curr` is `null`, so rreturn the `prev` as the new head.
