## [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)
### Problem
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

#### Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    # Check Nones
    if list1 == None:
        if list2 == None:
            return None
        return list2
    elif list2 == None:
        if list1 == None:
            return None
        return list1
    
    # Initialize head, tail, and ptrs
    ptr1, ptr2 = list1, list2
    if ptr1.val <= ptr2.val:
        head, tail = ptr1, ptr1
        ptr1 = ptr1.next
    else:
        head, tail = ptr2, ptr2
        ptr2 = ptr2.next

    # loop
    while ptr1 != None and ptr2 != None:
        temp1, temp2 = ptr1.next, ptr2.next

        if ptr1.val <= ptr2.val:
            tail.next = ptr1
            tail = ptr1
            ptr1 = temp1
        else:
            tail.next = ptr2
            tail = ptr2
            ptr2 = temp2

    # if anything remains, tail points to it
    if ptr1 == None:
        tail.next = ptr2
    else:
        tail.next = ptr1

    return head
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n) where `n` is the combined size of both linked lists
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
First check if either lists are empty and return either list that isn't empty or nothing in the case that they are both empty. Then initialize pointers, the head of the result, and the moving tail of the result. As long as both pointers point to a node, compare the values of both pointers, have the current tail's `next` pointer point to the lesser of the two, then finally shift the tail to it. If anything remains of either list after the loop breaks (when either pointer points to nothing), have the tail's `next` pointer point to the remaining list, and return the `head`.
