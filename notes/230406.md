## [143. Reorder List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/)
### Problem
You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

`L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln`

_Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

`L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …`

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
#### Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/04/reorder1linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]
```

#### Example 2
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/09/reorder2-linked-list.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is in the range`[1, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 1000`

### Preliminary Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def reorderList(head):
    arr = []
    curr = head
    while curr != None:
        arr.append(curr)
        curr = curr.next
    ll_len = len(arr)
    i = 0
    if ll_len % 2 == 0:
        while i < ll_len / 2:
            arr[i].next = arr[ll_len - i - 1]
            if i == (ll_len / 2) - 1:
                arr[ll_len - i - 1].next = None
            else:
                arr[ll_len - i - 1].next = arr[i + 1]
            i += 1
    else:
        while i < (ll_len // 2) + 1:
            if i != ll_len // 2:
                arr[i].next = arr[ll_len - i - 1]
                arr[ll_len - i - 1].next = arr[i + 1]
            else:
                arr[i].next = None
            i += 1
    return
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Record the linked list into an array and redirect the links of `node[i]` to point to `node[n-i-1]`. Quit at the halfway point and make sure the last node points to `null`.

#### Notes
- Very simple solution, but not space efficient and thus not time efficient either since we iterate through the list 2 times.

### [Best Available Solution](https://leetcode.com/problems/reorder-list/solutions/44992/java-solution-with-3-steps/?orderBy=most_votes)

#### Solution Code
```py
def reorderList(self, head):
    #step 1: find middle
    if not head: return []
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast.next and fast.next.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    #step 2: reverse second half
    prev, curr = None, slow.next
    while curr:
        nextt = curr.next
        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = nextt    
    slow.next = None
    
    #step 3: merge lists
    head1, head2 = head, prev
    while head2:
        nextt = head1.next
        head1.next = head2
        head1 = head2
        head2 = nextt
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Find the middle of the list by initializing a _slow_ pointer and a _fast_ pointer. The _fast_ pointer will move 2 times as fast as the slow pointer, and the loop will break before the _fast_ pointer points to `null`, thus making your _slow_ pointer end up at the middle (left-leaning). After this, reverse the second half of the linked list. Finally, merge the lists. `prev` in the code above, in an example with six nodes, should be the last node.

#### Notes
- `head1` and `head2` hop from one half to another since the second half is reversed.
