## [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list)
### Problem
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

Follow up: Could you do this in one pass?

#### Example 1
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/remove_ex1.jpg)
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
```
#### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

### Preliminary Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def removeNthFromEnd(head, n):
    arr, curr = [], head
    while curr:
        arr.append(curr)
        curr = curr.next

    if len(arr) != n:
        arr[len(arr)-n-1].next = arr[len(arr)-n].next
    else:
        return arr[len(arr)-n].next
    return head
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Store linked list in array, then set `next` of `n-1` node from the end to be the node at `n.next`. 

### [Best Available Solution](SOLUTION_LINK)

#### Solution Code
```py
def removeNthFromEnd_alt(head, n):
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    l, r = dummy, head
    for i in range(n):
        r = r.next
    while r:
        l = l.next
        r = r.next
    l.next = l.next.next
    return dummy.next
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Create a dummy node before the head and initialize a left pointer on it. Set a right pointer to be `n` spaces away from the head. Traverse both pointers until the right pointer is at the end. Set `l.next` to be `l.next.next`.
