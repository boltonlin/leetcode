## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle)
### Solution

#### Solution Code
```py
def hasCycle(head):
    slow, fast = head, head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(1)

#### _Backside_
Initialize two pointers, one moves slowly, the other moves twice as fast. If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually meet `slow` and return `true`. If there is no cycle, then the loop will break and `false` will be returned.

#### Additional Details
See Floyd's tortoise and hare. If there is a gap of size `n` between `slow` and `fast`, then when `slow` moves, the gap is extended by 1 (`n+1`). When fast moves in the same iteration, this gap is closed by 2 (`n+1-2`). This simplifies to `n-1`, and thus, in the worst case, the number of iterations it will take for `fast` to catch up to `slow`, and that `n` gap to be reduced to 0, is `n` times (`n-n`). An explanation can be seen on [neetcode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBTe7lFR3vc).
