### DFS Solution
#### Solution Code
```
# Recursive DFS
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        return 1 + max(self.maxDepth(root.left), self.maxDepth(root.right))

# Iterative DFS
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root) -> int:
        stack = [(root, 1)]
        max_depth = 1

        while stack:
            node, depth = stack.pop()

            if node.left:
                stack.append((node.left, depth+1))

            if node.right:
                stack.append((node.right, depth+1))

            max_depth = max(depth, max_depth)

        return max_depth

# Iterative BFS
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root) -> int:
        if not root: return 0

        q = deque([root])
        level = 0

        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            level += 1

        return level

Recursive DFS
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

Iterative DFS
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

Iterative BFS
- __Time Complexity__: O(n)
- __Space Complexity__: O(n)

#### _Backside_
Recursive DFS will call itself. The base case is if the called node is null, and if it isn't, then it will return 1 + the maximum value between the recursive calls of their left and right children.

Iterative DFS utilizes a stack, appending children if they exist with depth counters. The maximum depth is returned.

Iterative BFS utilizes a queue. Start with the root. In each iteration, dequeue each node, then queue its children. Add to the level for every level you've traversed. This is not very efficient.

In a balanced binary tree, DFS has better space complexities because the storage will only contain `log n` nodes at a time. Whereas in that same scenario, BFS will have a queue with the size of the max width of the tree.
