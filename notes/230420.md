## [235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/description/)
### Solution

#### Solution Code
```
def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root, p, q):
    ts = [root]

    while ts:
        tn = ts.pop()
        if tn.val == p.val: return p
        elif tn.val == q.val: return q
        if tn.val < p.val and tn.val < q.val: ts.append(tn.right)
        elif tn.val > p.val and tn.val > q.val: ts.append(tn.left)
        else: return tn
```

#### _Backside_
Traverse down the tree taking advantage of its BST nature. If the focused node is greater than all, then the nodes you're looking for are in the left subtree, and vice versa. If the focused node is ever one of the values, then the lowest common ancestor is the focused node itself. If the focused node's value is in between, then it must be the lowest common ancestor.
